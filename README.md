# Garagio

Garagio is a web based application enabling auto service customers to easily find and compare the best auto service deals around them, and book services with various providers. Their booking will automatically be fed into the Garagio shop management system for the auto service provider, which will feature lists of their customers, bookings, and a calendar with upcoming appointments. Garagio is intended to make auto shop administration more efficient, introducing transparency and cutting costs for both client and company.

The platform is implemented in Ruby on Rails, with a React frontend.

Garagio is a project in development for CPSC 439 at Yale University by Nico Burbano, Jonas Kavaliauskas, Chad Palmer, and Carl Viyar.
